##### Food and Wine Pairing Guide. 

This project will help you find a good food match for your wine or vice versa. The app presents you with two search options, one that will look for a food pairing for the specific wine, and other will look for a wine pairing for the choice of food. The search result will display on the page with the serving recommendations, wine descriptions and images.
